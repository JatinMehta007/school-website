# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This website was created using a React + Vite application for the school website. It employed React.js for development and is fully responsive for tablet, phone, and laptop users, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and layout. Additionally, client-side routing was established with React Router DOM. This website is unequivocally user-friendly.
